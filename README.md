# ZotHacks 2023 PetrTrips 


## Inspiration

Our goal was to make a web app to help users plan out their vacations by providing them with everything they needed.

## What it does

PetrTrips allows the user to type in any city and travels. It then will provide them with multiple hotel and tourism options in the nearby area.

## How we built it

For the front-end, we used React and Javascript to create an effective user interface.

For the back-end, we used fast.api with python for our backend and worked with Yelp.API, Geoapify’s Geocoding API, and Geoapify’s Places API.

## Challenges we ran into

On the back-end, we faced challenges with implementing APIs; the first few APIs we experimented with did not work for our program, setting us back. We eventually found Yelp.API, Geoapify’s Geocoding API, and Geoapify’s Places API, which we then implemented into our program. We experienced a lot of challenges with implementing the three APIs together, causing us to downscale our project by a lot. On the front-end, we had problems with connecting the frontend and backend projects to give a display. As expected, we also had technical issues such as problems pushing and pulling our work with Git.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of being able to learn how to use and implement APIs into our project. We are also very proud of creating a big project together as a group effort!

## What we learned

This was our first time using APIs as well as working on both an back- and front-end.

## What's next for PetrTrips

We want to add in pictures for the tourist attractions. We would also like to implement more APIs to provide extra resources like flight information and weather updates.

## For the GitHub

## Contributions:

Humayl A. Chishti - Worked on the front end and helped with debugging in the back end. First time using React and JS.
Jonathan Pan - Worked on the front end and helped debug the back end. I also created the communication between the front and back end, fetching the attraction's names and pictures.
Pavana Upadhyaya - I worked on the backend! This was my first time using APIs.
Paige Townsend - I worked on the backend. I primarily focused on getting the geoapify APIs to function and connected it to the yelp API despite us not being able to add the attractions to the frontend
